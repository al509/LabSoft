# Write f(x) function here in Python-style. For example:
x0=3
if x > 60:
    f = 1
else:
    f = 0
# Consider that you are just writing some func(x) that returns n value.
# Note that f may be either number of shots (then truncated to int) or effective radius variation (then  #round(f,3) applied)
# depending on settings in "Main features" window
# x can be float.
# Be careful, python-injections are posiible as this code interpreting
# in program without any checks and changes.
