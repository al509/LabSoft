# Write n(x) function here in Python-stye. For example:
if x > 60:
    n = 1
else:
    n = 0
# Consider that you are just writing some func(x) that returns n value.
#Note that n truncates to int in the end; x can be float.
# Be careful, python-injections are posiible as this code interpreting
# in program without any checks and changes.
